# Features

We often get asked what Tracktion Engine can do (and what it can't do) so this document aims to provide a rough summary of the features available. If you want more details, check out the source code or [documentation](https://tracktion.github.io/tracktion_engine/modules.html).

## Overview
As a very high level overview, Tracktion Engine provides a framework to create timelime based DAW-like apps. For the best example, take a look at [Tracktion Waveform Free](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free), which is built on top of Tracktion Engine. Most of the features are present in Tracktion Engine.

What Tracktion Engine doesn't provide is any kind of UI. You'll have to write code to display arrangements, tracks, clips, mixers, audio thumbnails, piano rolls etc. yourself. This may sound limiting but it's actually very useful as user-interfaces are what set apps apart and you want yours to be unique to your product and user base. For a starting point, take a look at some of the [examples](examples)
