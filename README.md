##### Welcome to the Tracktion Engine repository!
The aim of Tracktion Engine is to provide a high level data model and set of classes for building sequence based audio applications. You can build anything from a simple file-player or sequencer to a full blown DAW.

Take a look at the [features document](FEATURES.md) for the full range of features.

##### Supported Platforms
- macOS
- Windows
- Linux
- Raspberry PI
- iOS
- Android

*N.B. Tracktion Engine requires C++20*

## Getting Started
Tracktion Engine is supplied as a `JUCE module` so it can easily fit in to an existing JUCE application. You'll find the module code under `modules/tracktion_engine`. Additionally, JUCE is added as a Git Submodule here in order to build the examples.

To start with, clone the repo and recurse the submodules:
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Tracktion/tracktion_engine.git
```

## Examples
Example projects are located in `/examples`.
There are two main example projects, `DemoRunner` and `EngineInPluginDemo`. In each of these folder is a CMakeLists.txt file you can use to build them (or run the `build` script mentioned below).

`DemoRunner` contains a number of app examples showcasing various Engine functionality.
`EngineInPluginDemo` builds a plugin which contains Tracktion Engine and syncs the host timeline to the Edit's timeline.

Additionally there are `Benchmark` an `TestRunner` apps used by CI to test Engine functionality and performance.

#### Scripts
To generate all the examples for the running platform use the script in `/tests`.
These are bash scripts so if you're on Windows you can use the `Git Bash` shell that comes with Git to run the following.
```
$ cd tests
$ ./generate_examples
```
`generate_examples` will generate the IDE project files for you. Alternatively you can run the `build` script to build the examples as well, ready to run.

Once the example projects have been generated or built you can find them in `examples/example_name/build`.

#### CMake
Alternatively, you can run cmake in the root directory which will create a project with the `DemoRunner`, `EngineInPluginDemo`, `TestRunner` and `Benchmark` targets. E.g.
```shell
cmake -G <generator_name> -B build
```

## Tutorials
Once you're ready to dive in to the code, open the IDE files and have a read through the tutorials in `/tutorials`. You can view these on GitHub [here](/tutorials) to see the rendered Markdown.

## Documentation
We are still in the process of fleshing out Doxygen formatted comments but the Doxygen generated documentation can be found here: https://tracktion.github.io/tracktion_engine/modules.html

## Benchmarks
Benchmarks are really for our own internal use but might be of interest to some people:
