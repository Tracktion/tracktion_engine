// crill::spin_mutex is a spinlock with progressive backoff for safely and
// efficiently synchronising a real-time thread with other threads.
//
// crill::spin_mutex meets the standard C++ requirements for mutex
// [thread.req.lockable.req] and can therefore be used with std::scoped_lock
// and std::unique_lock as a drop-in replacement for std::mutex.
//
// try_lock() and unlock() are implemented by setting a std::atomic_flag and
// are therefore always wait-free. This is the main difference to a std::mutex
// which doesn't have a wait-free unlock() as std::mutex::unlock() may perform
// a system call to wake up a waiting thread.
//
// lock() is implemented with crill::progressive_backoff_wait, to prevent wasting
// energy and allow other threads to progress.
//
// crill::spin_mutex is not recursive; repeatedly locking it on the same thread
// is undefined behaviour (in practice, it will probably deadlock your app).
