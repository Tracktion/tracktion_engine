Tracktion Engine breaking changes
=====================

Develop
=======

Change
------
The old AudioNode based engine has been replaced by a new tracktion_graph based engine.

Possible Issues
---------------
Some classes will no longer be publicly available such as PlayHead, AudioNode nodes etc.

Workaround
----------
You'll have to update your code to use the new APIs. In most cases this shouldn't be a
problem as this is a move to remove the public nature of the engine, the higher level APIs
that you are using should stay the same. Some arguments to classes such as Plugin have
changed to remove dependancy on playback specific classed.
If you really need to use the old engine, see the archive/old_engine branch.

Rationale
---------
The move to the new engine greatly improves CPU performance, especially with multiple
threads and fixes PDC in a lot of obscure cases such as track to track routing and bussing.


Change
------
The PluginWindowConnection class has been removed to simplify the process of
creating plugin windows and connecting them to a PluginWindowState.

Possible Issues
---------------
PluginWindowState now takes an Edit in its constructor rather than an Engine.
The UIBehaviour method createPluginWindowConnection has been changed to
createPluginWindow which now simply needs to create and return a Component
which will be used to show your plugin UI.

Workaround
----------
You'll have to update your code to use the new APIs.

Rationale
---------
The old PluginWindowConnection class was an attempt at communicating via IPC
for sandboxed plugins. However, this is no longer necessary as it's possible
to encapsulate a sandboxed plugin completely within the juice::AudioProcessor
classes.
The new API is much simpler for the standard use cases.
