Tracktion Engine breaking changes
=====================

Develop
=======

Change
------
The PluginWindowConnection class has been removed to simplify the process of
creating plugin windows and connecting them to a PluginWindowState.

Possible Issues
---------------
PluginWindowState now takes an Edit in its constructor rather than an Engine.
The UIBehaviour method createPluginWindowConnection has been changed to
createPluginWindow which now simply needs to create and return a Component
which will be used to show your plugin UI.

Workaround
----------
You'll have to update your code to use the new APIs.

Rationale
---------
The old PluginWindowConnection class was an attempt at communicating via IPC
for sandboxed plugins. However, this is no longer necessary as it's possible
to encapsulate a sandboxed plugin completely within the juice::AudioProcessor
classes.
The new API is much simpler for the standard use cases.
